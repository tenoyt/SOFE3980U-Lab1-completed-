## Objective: 
1. Be familiar with Maven as a software project management tool.
2. Understand how to create, configure and build Maven projects.
3. Be able to automatically generate Documentation of the project.
4. Be able to configure the project to automatically add dependencies to the jar file.
5. Learn how to write and run tests a the project.


# Design: 
1. Add three functions to the **Binary** class that perform the following operations over two binary variables. The output of the function should be also a binary function:  
    * **OR**: bitwise logical OR
    * **AND**: bitwise logical AND  
    * **Multiply**: multiply two binary variables (**Note**: you may use the Add function)
2. Update the App.java file to call the new three functions. You may update it to be more interactive and user friendly.
3. Add three test functions at least for each of new function added into the Binary class

# Deliverables:
1. A GitHub link includes the whole project folder (except the target folder) with the final version of the binary class and the test cases.
2. A report discussing the source and testing code of the design part.
3. Audible video of about 3 minutes showing the building and running phases of the project as well as the passed tests. Also, show the generated documentation for the functions you added in the design section.
